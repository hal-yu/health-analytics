## Summary of variables
For this assignment, I created the variable "Five" and assigned it the number, 5. 
For the string variable, I created the variable "string" and assigned it the value "string." 
For the list, I assigned the name list and gave a list of values ranging from 1 to 5. 

## Summary of dictionary
For the dictionary, I named it "Yu_Dictionary." In this dictionary, I had several key value pairs.
It contains the first name, Haley, and the last name, Yu. The age is a number, 23.
The contacts is a list and the address is a nested dictionary that contains the country, state, county, and zip code. 

## Summary of Function
The variable gradePointAverage is defined and assigned with two classes, HHA506 and HHA503. If the grade for HHA506 is 93 or higher, then the output is "good." 
If the outcome is not greater than 93, then the output is "bad." For the class HHA503, if the grade is 93 or higher, it is considered "good," else "bad." 
Two variables are defined as HHA506Input and HHA503Output and assigned grades and inserted into the output function. 
The print for HHA 506 GPA should state the GPA for HHA 506 and since the number is equal to or greater than 93, it is interpreted as good. 
The print for HHA 503 GPA should state the GPA for HHA 503 and since the number is less than 93, it is interpreted as bad.
